<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>The Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science has long been one of the world's finest. We pride ourselves on our deep commitment to intellectual excellence, and to supporting inquiry and teaching that combines rigor, relevance, and openness to a variety of methodological and analytical approaches. The size of our faculty, currently 52, allows us to do justice to the study of a vast range of important issues in political life. We offer an unusual combination of depth and breadth in the major subject areas of political science. We cover not only the traditional subfields of American politics, comparative politics, international relations, and political theory, but also areas such as formal theory, methods, organizations and public policy, political behavior, and public law, as well as the politics of every major region on the globe. Reflecting the department's broad understanding of our subject matter and enduring commitment to interdisciplinary inquiry, many members have joint appointments in other schools (including Business, Information, Law, and Public Policy) and departments (including Economics and Sociology), as well as strong connections to a variety of research centers around campus.</p>




<p>Each year, the department serves approximately 900 declared and intended undergraduate majors, and graduates approximately 400 students with a BA degree. Outstanding undergraduate education is central to our mission. To reflect our commitment to undergraduates, we have made several major innovations in recent years, including a new set of requirements for graduation, a substantially enhanced Honors program, and a new seminar program to increase opportunities for undergraduates to work with faculty in small groups.</p>




<p>The department has an outstanding doctoral program, designed to prepare students for careers in university teaching and to conduct advanced research. Approximately 25 students enter our program each year and roughly 150 are enrolled at any given time. Our graduate students take courses that offer state-of-the-art training in the conduct of research, combined with a very wide-ranging curriculum addressing fundamental issues in politics. We also seek to integrate them rapidly into an intellectual community that prizes scholarly development through the exchange of ideas and the sharing of work in progress. After completing their work here, many will go on to take jobs at the country's leading colleges and universities.</p>

Politics is the art and noise of collective governance under conditions of scarce resources, conflicting interests, diverse beliefs, uncertain outcomes, and unequal power. In 1AC, we learn about the institutions, ideologies, and processes that constitute politics in the U.S. In fulfilling the AC requirement, we further examine how power, equality, and diversity are configured and contested in our politics.

This course aims to furnish students with the tools necessary to study political processes and outcomes in comparative perspective. It is divided into three parts. The first introduces the basic concepts and methods of comparative analysis and examines our principal unit of analysis: the state. The second surveys the range of political regimes under which people live around the world. The third examines three</span><span class="deschide"> key variables that both influence political outcomes and are influenced by political processes: institutions, identity, and agency. Throughout the course we will use a wide variety of country examples, but will not focus exclusively on any particular set of countries.</span><br/>

This course provides an overview of some of the methods employed in political science research. Its purpose is to familiarize you with the scientific study of politics, and to teach you how to pose and answer<br/>
empirical research questions using appropriate evidence and arguments. Along the way we will learn about how to formulate and evaluate theories, how to design research to discover whether a<br/>
particular</span><span class="deschide"> theory holds up empirically, and some basic research strategies. By the end of the course you should have the tools to critically evaluate the kinds of social science arguments found in everyday life and be able to conduct your own independent research.</span><br/>

In this class, the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British crown, the rise of slavery, and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials, including biographies, history, and literature, and contemporary images from American popular</span><span class="deschide"> culture such as film, news and magazine articles, and music, we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans, Euopean immigrants, and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges.</span><br/>

What is governance? How should we explain its emergence? What are its implications for public policy and democracy? This course uses debates about contemporary governance to examine four approaches to political science and political theory. The approaches are rational choice theory, institutionalism, Marxism, and poststructuralism. The course looks at the narrative that each approach provides of the origins and workings of governance since 1979</span><span class="deschide">, and at the way these narratives embody theoretical commitments about rationality and power, structure and agency, and democracy. It thus promotes an awareness of the way questions about contemporary governance are inextricably linked to philosophical and normative commitments.</span><br/>

The goal of this class is to familiarize students with the various ways in which actors can manage and resolve their conflicts. Conflict management in both international and civil conflicts will be discussed. Students will learn about negotiation, mediation, arbitration and adjudication, sanctions, military intervention, peacekeeping, nation-building, and the design of peace agreements. We will also talk about the role of the United Nations</span><span class="deschide">, regional organizations, and major powers like the U.S. in conflict management. While the main goal of the class is to familiarize students with central concepts and theories of conflict management, we will also take a look at cases that illustrate when, how and why different strategies work.</span><br/>

This course provides an introduction to game theory and its application in social science, especially political science and economics. The purposes of the course are to give students a sense of the field of game theory and how political scientists use it in making arguments about how government and politics work, to develop students' intuition about strategic situations in everyday life, and to</span><span class="deschide"> develop students' analytical capabilities generally. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to depict social situations as simple game theoretic models, analyze those models to understand how the behaviors of the individuals involved are mutually reinforcing, and apply computer-based tools to evaluate under conditions of uncertainty.</span><br/>

This course examines the interaction between politics and markets, both in theory and in practice, explicitly linking classic works on political economy with current policy debates. We study how political systems and markets are organized in a wide range of different national settings, looking at both history and contemporary issues. Topics include: 1) early industrialization in Britain and the United States, 2) late industrialization in continental</span><span class="deschide"> Europe and Japan, 3) the varieties of capitalism in contemporary industrialized countries, 4) the newly industrializing economics of Latin America and East Asia, 5) the problems of development, and 6) the transition from communism to a market economy in Eastern Europe and China.</span><br/>

This course will examine international migration from a historical and comparative perspective, looking at why people migrate, how citizens respond to the migration, and how states respond to migration. The first part of the course looks at the changing relationship between the state, immigrants, and citizenship. Turning to case studies, we will examine five different types of receiving states, each confronted</span><span class="deschide"> with a different form of migration: a traditional immigrant state, a post-colonial state, a non-traditional immigrant state that imports migrant workers, a highly industrialized latecomer state, and a newly industrialized state.</span><br/>

In the present era political, economic, and social organization powerfully influence national capacity to assure economic success, real and rising incomes for the population, and political success, basic survival, and the projection of its purposes and values. This course looks at the continual process of international competition and transformation, and examines which factors separate the winners from the losers. We will gain leverage into</span><span class="deschide"> these questions by examining critical moments in the 20th and 21st centuries and analyze according to national responses. What choices signal success? Can the failures be avoided? The course will discuss whether globalization is shunting aside national political choice, or whether globalization is in fact a sequence of national and regional stories played out on a larger stage. We will consider how economic constraint structures political choice and national response to the global economy. But we will also examine how political developments shape market dynamics and national innovations. We will learn about all sorts of things from the politics of French fashion to why Japanese make good cars.</span><br/>

These conflicts can lead to violence and hardship. They can also result in creative adaptations and solutions based in political and administrative institutions and processes that build peace.

Throughout the course, students will be introduced to social science and environmental science perspectives.

The course begins by briefly considering a number of alternative analytic approaches to linking human nature and politics and then considers such problems as political ideology, persuasion, compliance, protest</span><span class="deschide">, violence, and leadership in terms of these approaches. The course considers both mass and elite political behavior.

Students will explore, discuss, and understand the relationship between racial/ethnic group formation, group-based beliefs and behavior, and politics. Our focus is on the US today, but with an appreciation of how the racial politics of the here and now is rooted in history and human psychology. We cover Black Politics, Latinx Politics, Asian American Politics, Native American Politics and White Politics, general concepts of identity, immigration, citizenship, class</span><span class="deschide">, and intersectionality. We examine both how race and ethnicity affect politics, as well as how politics can shape the boundaries, definitions and behaviors of groups. These behaviors include voting, elite decisions, civic engagement, protests, and media content and usage.</span><br/>

Some of the most enduring and violent conflicts in America center on race. The goal of this course is to explore, discuss, and better understand the relationship between perceptions of racial identity, attributions of racial difference, and politics, broadly defined. We focus on the recent and persistent debates about racism, identity, rights, representation, citizenship, conflict, and coalitions. A repeated theme of this course is the question</span><span class="deschide"> whether racial order and inequality are essential to, or an exception from, the liberal democracy in the U.S. This is a lecture course with intensive readings, written assignments, and in-class discussion.</span><br/>

This course explores the way societies try to address and solve difficult and seemingly intractable public problems. Can we attribute success or failure to institutions and their capacity to solve problems? Are problems difficult to solve because they are complex or because of a failure of political will? What are the characteristics of organizations or communities that are able to solve problems? How are public problems framed and how are</span><span class="deschide"> they used to mobilize constituencies? The course draws on literature in public administration, public policy studies, and democratic theory to try to better understand some of the major social, political, environmental, and economic problems of our contemporary world.</span><br/>

This course provides an introduction to research design in comparative politics; it is the second semester of the two-semester introductory graduate sequence for the comparative<br/>
sub-field. We will focus on various topics relevant to doing research, such as how to formulate research questions; develop concepts and measures; bolster the validity of descriptive and causal inferences; and use various qualitative and quantitative methods</span><span class="deschide"> in the service of diverse substantive agenda. Developing the ability to critique research is one important objective. However, the primary goal of the course is to provide a first foundation for actually doing research.</span><br/>

New digital technologies, changing market structures, and innovative business organizations are transforming the economic and social landscape of the advanced industrial countries. The policy issues associated with this transformation pose fundamental philosophical and political questions of how to organize our markets, polity, and society. The means of making and implementing these choices is politics. The necessarily global scope of the E-conomy</span><span class="deschide"> extends the political and policy challenges to the international arena. This course will explore the literature on the political economy of the Internet to determine what policy choices -- hence which political debates -- are and will be most important.

This graduate seminar is designed to introduce students to the comparative study of political violence. The course examines two broad themes through a variety of theoretical and empirical approaches. The first theme focuses on why individuals choose to rebel: When does violence become a strategy for resolving conflict? Why do individuals participate in violence? How is violence organized? The second theme focuses on how states choose to repress</span><span class="deschide"> citizens: When are human rights violations committed? When does a state use violence over other strategies?

This seminar provides an introduction to the major debates in comparative political economy. Although the empirical focus is on the affluent democracies, many of the debates and issues analyzed have implications for other regions. The course is divided into two main parts. The first part examines leading theoretical perspectives on political economy, such as Friedman, Marx, Weber, and Polanyi. The second part of the course is more topical. It probes</span><span class="deschide"> a number of examples of economic development, crisis, and change, with an eye to assessing alternative theoretical perspectives.</span><br/>

With changes in technology, the internationalization of production and the massive increase in trans-border transactions of all kinds, it has been argued that we live and work in an era of substantively different capitalism. Were this true, it has deep implications for politics and for political economy. This graduate seminar explores the validity of this claim of a &quot;new capitalism&quot; through a variety of materials, starting with the question of whether &quot;Fordism&quot;</span><span class="deschide"> ever existed, moving on to the question of whether &quot;Post-Fordism&quot; exists and ending with a variety of ethnographic studies that show how global production chains shape culture, gender, and hieraarchy/power.</span><br/>

How has religion shaped the structure of the international system? How should IR scholars approach the role that religion plays in contemporary affairs? How does religion constrain or motivate international conflict? This seminar seeks to guide students through readings in the social sciences, from psychology and sociology to anthropology and political science, that explore the intersection of religion and international relations. We will examine</span><span class="deschide"> a variety of theoretical approaches to the topic of religion and global politics, explore religious origins of the modern state system, and analyze the influence of religion on historical and comtemporary conflicts, with a particular focus on ethnic conflict, terrorism, and peacemaking.</span><br/>

This seminar will cover the topic of international cooperation. We will begin by reviewing the positions of central IR paradigms on the possibility of international cooperation and the role of international institutions. We will talk about why states want to cooperate, which obstacles need to be overcome, and how international institutions can facilitate interstate cooperation. We examine questions concerning the design of international institutions, the extent</span><span class="deschide"> of compliance they evoke, and their effect in various areas of international cooperation. We also discuss how domestic politics affect a state’s willingness to cooperate and comply with international institutions.</span><br/>

Civil conflict, committed primarily by non-state actors, often results in international intervention<br/>
in some form. This course, then, focuses on two themes: first, why does civil conflict occur?<br/>
What motivates individuals and groups to resort to violence? What tactics do they use? How do<br/>
they expect to succeed? Second, why do international actors intervene in civil conflict? What are<br/>
their aims in intervening? Are they</span><span class="deschide"> successful in those goals or in others?<br/></span><br/>

This course presents essential methodological concepts, ideas, and tools students need to know before beginning their study of the formal and quantitative methods tools used in political science research. Topics covered include functions, limits, continuity, calculus, optimization, probability and statistics, and linear algebra. Entire courses are often devoted to each of these topics (e.g., Math 1A-1B, 53, 54; Stat 101, 134, 135), and this course</span><span class="deschide"> clearly cannot provide an equally comprehensive treatment.

The course will study public policy in its connection with business. Policy is seen as an endogenous outcome of a game where diverse political forces try to shape public decisions to their advantage. The focus is broad, covering both theory and evidence. The aim is to analyze how a wide range of political institutions and processes affect public policy and economic performance. The ultimate goal of the course is to acquaint students with the topics at hand</span><span class="deschide">, and to consolidate their control of formal theory and quantitative techniques by discussing their application to the subject.</span><br/>

Explores alternative approaches to concept formation, measurement, and causal inference, based on large- and small-N analysis and case studies. Analytic tensions that motivate the course derive from, among other sources, the pressure on case-study and small-N researchers to strive for analytic rigor</span><span class="deschide"> and generality; and the skepticism of some statisticians about quantitative inference - both descriptive and casual - in social science.</span><br/>

This graduate seminar is designed to introduce students to the comparative study of ethnic politics. It provides an overview of theoretical questions and methodological innovations across five topics: the conceptualization and measurement of ethnicity; the sources of ethnic mobilization and cleavage choice; the consequences of ethnic mobilization for democratization and democracy; the impact of ethnicity on redistributive politics; and the relationship between ethnicity</span><span class="deschide"> and patterns of violence ranging from urban riots to civil wars. Readings for each topic are drawn from various political science subfields as well as from other disciplines. They also reflect a range of regional contexts, including Eastern Europe, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of the course is to provide graduate students with a basis for undertaking their own original research on questions relating to ethnic politics. It should enable them to critically engage recent scholarship, understanding which theories have yet to be adequately tested and which theoretically interesting questions have yet to be asked.</span><br/>

In response to growing criticism of government bureaucracy, public skepticism of expert authority, and an explosion of advocacy groups, a variety of new governance strategies have been developed. These new strategies are characterized by five broad themes: the use of markets or market mechanisms to increase efficiency; an emphasis on holding public agencies</span><span class="deschide"> accountable and making them more transparent; the development of coordinating networks to link public agencies with each other and with stakeholders; the extensive involvement of non-state organizations in all aspects of governing; and renewed attention to the civic role of individuals and communities. The course investigates the extent to which these new strategies succeed in making the governance process more efficient, accountable, effective, representative, and civic.</span><br/>

The course meets regularly during parts of the fall semester and irregularly during the spring semester. In the first</span><span class="deschide"> few weeks of the course, we discuss the process of moving from research topic to research question; and we survey published articles by recent Ph.D. students/assistant professors, focusing on the structure and nature of the writing and presentation as well the quality of the argument and evidence.</span><br/>

This course is intended for all new graduate student instructors (GSI) in the Department of Political Science, and is meant to be taken simultaneously with the first semester of teaching as a GSI. The course functions as a participatory workshop. Although the course is intended for first-time GSIs, it is not a course in &quot;how to be a GSI,&quot; but rather, how to be an effective political science teacher, now and at later steps in professional</span><span class="deschide"> careers. Workshop time will be divided among presentations by the instructor, discussion of required readings, and discussion of weekly assignments in relation to challenges encountered by GSIs in the course of their teaching.</span><br/>
