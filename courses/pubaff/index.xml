This course is designed to introduce mid-career executives to three things: a typology of “kinds of problems” that confront those leading organizations; a sampling of major problems confronting leaders in the next decades; and a sampling of solutions to problems confronting leaders. It introduces the rest of the Berkeley MPA summer core program with examples of the kinds of problems that modern leaders must confront and the kinds of solutions that must be devised.</span><span class="deschide"> The course features at least one article or book by a GSPP faculty member in each session except the last.</span><br/>

In this course, we are going to study the use of research methods, statistics, and probability theory in public decision making. We will begin with case studies of important public policy topics where key decisions depend on the interpretation of results from empirical research or on probabilistic assessments of the likelihood of various outcomes. We will then study the basics of probability</span><span class="deschide"> theory, statistical sampling, hypothesis testing, and inferring causality.</span><br/>

There is increasing emphasis throughout the public and non-profit sectors to invest in practices that are “evidence based&quot;. In this course, we are going to study the role of empirical research in public decision making and the common research strategies employed to study problems of causal inference and prediction. The effectiveness of specific intervention often relies</span><span class="deschide"> on research attempting to demonstrate that one variable (for example, a particular educational intervention) has a causal effect on an outcome of interest (for example, successful completion of high school). We will study the various research strategies that are employed to uncover causal effects and to evaluate the effects of programmatic interventions.</span><br/>

The objective of this course is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of ethical arguments in the process and substance of policymaking. Those who seek to govern well inescapably confront questions of value in their political, professional and personal choices. The discussion of ethical dilemmas is designed to provoke analytic reflection on the moral challenges and responsibilities</span><span class="deschide"> for public policymaking in a democracy. The focus is on the many and often competing obligations, commitments and values that should guide public actors, as well as on the public principles that guide the design of good public policy.</span><br/>

This course focuses on creating and implementing change within public organizations through the application of strategic planning, innovation and leadership. We will discuss where new ideas come from and how they can be generated, evaluated and implemented. The methods developed in other parts of the summer curriculum become the support for proving that new ideas are good ideas</span><span class="deschide"> (or for finding out that they are bad ideas). We will explore how each method can be useful to a leader (both formal and informal) at various levels within a public organization through case studies and real world examples. The course will introduce leadership themes which will be explored further in PUB AFF 283: Leading People and Organizations.</span><br/>

In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and gene editing will transform the way we work and the way we live. The speed, scope, and scale of the technological changes are unprecedented, which pose serious challenges to policy makers – how do you create agile public policies to not only keep up with technologies, but to anticipate future trends in this fast-moving digital economy? We will take a practical</span><span class="deschide"> approach to examine the issues and challenges of “tech policy” from a global perspective, including topics such as digital trade, data privacy, digital payment, artificial intelligence, gene editing, blockchain, and more.</span><br/>
