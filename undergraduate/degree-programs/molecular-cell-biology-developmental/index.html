				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Molecular and Cell Biology: Cell &amp; Developmental Biology (CDB) emphasis focuses on investigating the dynamic mechanisms of fundamental cellular processes in both normal and aberrant physiological contexts such as disease and developmental disorders. The undergraduate tracks within this emphasis are ideal for students interested in the medical and health sciences as well as basic research and teaching careers, and careers in industry and the public sector.</p>
<p>Cells are the most basic unit of life. They house DNA, make proteins, produce energy, provide structure, transmit neural information, and sometimes cause disease. The dramatic array of structures and functions that cells perform are enabled by the process of development, which coordinates fundamental and diverse cellular changes and, at the most impressive, produces an entire complex organism like ourselves from one simple starting cell.</p>
<p>Armed with an array of modern methods, including advanced microscopy and powerful genomic approaches, cell and developmental biologists uncover the molecular cues that are responsible for the complex structures within cells, their functions, and the striking changes they undergo during development. The faculty in Cell and Developmental Biology at Berkeley are at the cutting edge of study in a range of important topics including stem cell development, cancer and cellular dysfunction, and understanding of mechanisms that allow cells to divide, move, sense and transmit signals, and regenerate.</p>
<p>Each of the two CDB emphasis tracks within the MCB major, Cell &amp; Systems Biology (Track 1) and Medical Biology &amp; Physiology (Track 2), requires six upper division courses.</p>
<h3><span>Minor Program</span></h3>

<p>MCB is not an impacted major. Therefore, the program will accept any interested student who meets the minimum course and GPA requirements and is realistically able to complete the major requirements during the student's time at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>In order to declare the MCB major, students must have completed or be enrolled in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201A" title="BIOLOGY 1A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'BIOLOGY 1A');">BIOLOGY 1A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201AL" title="BIOLOGY 1AL" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'BIOLOGY 1AL');">BIOLOGY 1AL</a></span> (C or better on first midterm) and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CHEM%203B" title="CHEM 3B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CHEM 3B');">CHEM 3B</a></span> (past the early drop deadline), have at least a 2.0 overall GPA, a 2.0 GPA in the courses taken for the major, a 2.0 GPA in any upper division courses taken for the major, and know which emphasis they will declare. Intended MCB students are not required to have completed the Math or Physics requirement at the time of declaration (though the requirement must be met in order to graduate).</p>
<p>To start the major declaration process, students must fill out the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/internal/uao/declaration/" target="_blank">MCB major declaration form online</a>.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-309de6d1-69dd-3dc8-a4e9-d76656518261">Once the declaration form has been processed, students will receive an email with instructions to come in to meet with a staff advisor. Students should bring a printed copy of their Academic Summary from CalCentral to the Undergraduate Advising Office (3060 Valley Life Sciences Building) to discuss their academic plan. </span> When signing in, students should inform the intake adviser that they declared online. Please note that major declarations are limited during the first week of class and the first week of course enrollment Phase 1. Any restrictions will be advertised on the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">MCB Undergraduate homepage</a> and in the weekly MCB-News email. </p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill requirements specific to their major program and declared emphasis.</p>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for letter graded credit.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs. Double majors and simultaneous degrees are limited to a two course overlap. </li>
	<li>Students must maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of at least a 2.0 GPA overall, a 2.0 GPA in the required major coursework (lower and upper division), and a 2.0 GPA in the upper division coursework for the major.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>

All MCB students complete the same lower division coursework to gain critical training in biology, mathematics, chemistry, and physics. All or most lower division coursework is completed before major declaration. Upon declaring the major, MCB students choose an emphasis, or specialization, which determines the upper division core courses they will take and elective choices from which they will choose. Students can choose among several areas of specialization; emphases are broadly defined along divisional lines and allow students to focus on a more defined topic within MCB. MCB students who elect to participate in independent research may choose from sponsoring research laboratories within any MCB division, or in laboratories outside the department (other Berkeley departments, LBNL, CHORI, UCSF, biotechnology companies). The MCB major provides excellent preparation for many careers and postbaccalaureate training programs, including graduate programs and health-related professional programs (e.g., medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy), science writing, law school, biotechnology, teaching, and academic research.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Describe basic biological concepts and principles.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the different levels of biological organization, from molecules to ecosystems.</li>
	<li>Understand that biology has a chemical, physical, and mathematical basis.</li>
	<li>Explain the importance of the scientific method to understanding natural phenomena.</li>
	<li>Effectively communicate scientific data and ideas, both orally and in writing.</li>
	<li>Critically evaluate data, develop a hypothesis, and design experiments to address an interesting and novel problem.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate advanced knowledge in a specialized field of molecular and cell biology.</li>
</ol>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>MCB offers three types of undergraduate advising: staff advisers, faculty advisers, and peer advisers.</p>
<h3>Staff Advisers</h3>
<p>Staff academic advisers are trained to support students and assist them in successfully completing their MCB major. They are excellent resources for questions concerning administration and academics or finding out about other available services. Students should see a staff adviser for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ask questions about major requirements.</li>
	<li>Ask advice about schedule planning.</li>
	<li>Declare the MCB major.</li>
	<li>Consult about research opportunities, graduate and professional schools, career opportunities, scholarships, and internships.</li>
	<li>Get information and course control numbers (CCN's) for independent research.</li>
	<li>Request general assistance, advice or information.</li>
	<li>Find out about upcoming events and programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff advisers are primarily available for drop-in advising, though limited appointments are available for more complex issues such as probation, academic difficulty, and readmission. Students who would like to schedule an appointment should call 510-643-8895 during drop-in advising hours.</p>
<p>The general email address is <a href="mailto:mcbuao@berkeley.edu">mcbuao@berkeley.edu</a>. This email is checked daily, Monday through Friday, so students will receive an answer to questions within one business day.</p>
<h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Faculty advisers are MCB professors assigned to advise students about the MCB Department, its courses, research, and other academic issues. Students typically first meet with a faculty adviser when they declare an MCB major. Students should see their faculty advisers for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Receive guidance toward achieving academic and career goals.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about the content of MCB courses.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about biological research and about the field of biology in general.</li>
	<li>Ask for recommendations on which graduate schools to attend.</li>
	<li>Review and approve major declaration plan, after speaking with a UAO staff adviser first.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a list of advisers and their office hours, please see the <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/advising/advising-office/advising-services/" target="_blank">department's website</a>. Office hours listed are designated for drop-in advising unless otherwise noted. Faculty adviser office hours are effective from the first day of instruction until the final day of instruction for the fall and spring semesters. Faculty advisers are not available for office hours during winter or summer break. Students may refer to staff drop-in advising hours during summer sessions and non-instructional periods.</p>
<h3>Peer Adviser Walk-in Services (PAWS)</h3>
<p>Peer advisers are junior and senior MCB majors who volunteer their time to complement the UAO advising services by sharing their knowledge of and experience with lower-division requirements and upper division classes, experience with student groups on campus, preparation for life beyond the BA, and use of various campus resources. To see the schedule and more information about who the peer advisers are and which courses they have taken, click <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/advising/advising-office/peer-advising/" target="_blank" title="paws">here</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="academicopportunitiestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>Under the guidance of a faculty member and/or research mentor, undergraduates in the MCB major may have the opportunity to work in a laboratory to gain valuable experience in scientific research. Interested students must take the initiative to make such arrangements. Over forty percent of MCB majors work in a lab to gain valuable experience in scientific research. To get started, students should talk with classmates, peer advisers, a staff undergraduate adviser, graduate student instructors (GSIs), and faculty about their interest in learning more about laboratory research. For more information on research, see <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/research/research/lab" target="_blank" title="how to find a lab position">How to Find a Lab Position</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits of research:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Science is a way to figure things out, so doing research will aid students in other aspects of their life. Students ask and answer open ended questions and link seemingly disconnected pieces of information to find results that were not predicted.</li>
	<li>Explore things at the cutting edge and that no one has explored before.</li>
	<li>Learn tenacity, problem solving, and to be critical about the details because things have to be reproducible. </li>
	<li>Solve mysteries and experience the excitement of discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may receive academic credit for their work by enrolling in an independent study course: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%2099" title="MCELLBI 99" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 99');">MCELLBI 99</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20199" title="MCELLBI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 199');">MCELLBI 199</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196A" title="MCELLBI H196A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196A');">MCELLBI H196A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196B" title="MCELLBI H196B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196B');">MCELLBI H196B</a></span>.  Enrollment applications are due in the Undergraduate Advising Office by the fifth week of each semester.</p>

The course is intended for non-majors and will begin by briefly providing necessary background in microbiology and immunology. The primary focus in each subsequent week, however, will be</span><span class="deschide"> on discussing a particular infectious disease. The course will be broad in scope covering biological, historical, ethical and social implications of each disease.</span><br/>

This lab course is an introduction to mammalian neuroanatomy for non-MCB majors. We will do dissections, explore physical anatomical models, and observe microscopic structures within preserved brain slices from a variety of mammalian species. The hands-on exploration of anatomy is key to understanding how the different functional regions of the nervous system are interconnected. Besides gaining a better understanding</span><span class="deschide"> of anatomy, you will gain important scientific skills such as conducting parts of a neurological exam, fluorescent and light microscopy, reading MRI scans and conducting fine dissections. The course will culminate with a group project using the online Allen Brain Atlas to investigate a novel scientific question.</span><br/>

The prevailing mutation theory holds that 3-6 gene mutations convert normal to cancer cells. But, this theory does not explain why cancers: 1) are autonomous and immortal – unlike any conventional mutations; 2) have individual clonal karyotypes and parallel clonal transcriptomes – much like conventional species; 3) Carcinogens generate cancer only after conspicuous latent periods of years to decades – but mutations change phenotypes immediately;</span><span class="deschide"> 4) are at once clonal and heterogeneous within clonal margins; and 5) form metastatic and drug-resistant subspecies with variant karyotypes. To explain these unexplained characteristics, this course tests a new theory that carcinogenesis is a form of speciation.</span><br/>
