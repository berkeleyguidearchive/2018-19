 <p>All students who will enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by satisfying the Entry Level Writing Requirement (ELWR).</p> <p>Students may satisfy that requirement by passing the Analytical Writing Placement Examination (AWPE). (Passing the AWPE is only one method of satisfying the ELWR.)</p> <p><strong>High school students</strong> planning to attend a UC campus may take the Analytical Writing Placement Examination in May of their senior year. (Students selected for the May exam are sent the test notification letter in April.)</p> <p><strong>Admitted students</strong> who have not yet satisfied the requirement may take the exam their first semester at Berkeley.</p> <p>The <a href=" http://writing.berkeley.edu/node/78" target="_blank">UC Entry Level Writing Requirement website</a> provides information on how to satisfy the requirement. In addition, it provides the examination scoring guide, sample past examinations, and sample student essays.</p> <p>The requirement may also be met by earning a grade of C or higher in an acceptable composition course offered at Berkeley.</p> <table class="sc_courselist" width="100%"> <caption class="hidden noscript">Course List</caption> <colgroup><col class="codecol"/><col class="titlecol"/><col align="char" char="." class="hourscol"/></colgroup><thead><tr class="hidden noscript"><th scope="col">Code</th><th scope="col">Title</th><th scope="col" class="hourscol">Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="even lastrow firstrow"><td class="codecol"><a href="/search/?P=COLWRIT%20R1A" title="COLWRIT R1A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'COLWRIT R1A');">COLWRIT R1A</a></td><td>Accelerated Reading and Composition</td><td class="hourscol"></td></tr> </tbody></table>
