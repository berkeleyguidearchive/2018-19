 <p><span class="s1">Satisfaction of the American Cultures Breadth Requirement is a prerequisite for every bachelor's degree awarded to students. The American Cultures Breadth Requirement is satisfied by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, a course expressly approved for that purpose by the appropriate committee of the Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate.Â The courses that satisfy this requirement must be integrative and comparative and address theoretical and analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American history and society. Each course will take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latinos, and European Americans. Students may choose to take an AC course in their field of study in order to expand their experience within the field. However, many students use their AC course as an opportunity to take a course outside of their major.</span></p> <p>For a current list of instructors and courses approved to meet this requirement, visit the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult/approved-berkeley" target="_blank">Berkeley Academic Senate website</a>.</p>
